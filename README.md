## General information about analysis.
There are three parts to this Lesson:

First, configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

Next, build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

The Robo Advisor using Amazon Lex can be viewed at this link. [Amazon Lex](https://youtu.be/9In63Aeqz7U)

Finally, enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

The code used for the Amazon Lambda function can be found in this link:
[Lambda Code.](/recommendPortfolio.py)


The video for the Robo Advisor using Amazon Lex with a Lambda function is located here:  [Amazon Lex with Lambda function.](https://youtu.be/L2iDKACYBhE)

The video shows the outcome for each risk level, followed by the age restriction along with invalid age error, finally the video shows the error for the minimum needed to invest.
